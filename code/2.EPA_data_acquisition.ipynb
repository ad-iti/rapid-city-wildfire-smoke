    "This code example was developed by Dr. David W. McDonald for use in DATA 512, a course in the UW MS Data Science degree program.

    "This example illustrates how to request data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Service (AQS) API. This is a historical API and does not provide real-time air quality data. The [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the API provides definitions of the different call parameter and examples of the various calls that can be made to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works systematically through example calls, requesting an API key, using 'list' to get various IDs and parameter values, and using 'daily summary' to get summary data that meets specific condistions. The notebook contains example function definitions that could be reused in other code. In general, the notebook explains each step along the way, referring back to possible output. Some of the explanations are tailored to the specific example requests of the API. Changing values to explore the results of the API is probably useful, but that will result in some explanations being out of sync with the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The US EPA was created in the early 1970's. The EPA reports that they only started broad based monitoring with standardized quality assurance procedures in the 1980's. Many counties will have data starting somewhere between 1983 and 1988. However, some counties still do not have any air quality monitoring stations. The API helps resolve this by providing calls to search for monitoring stations and data using either station ids, or a county designation or a geographic bounding box. This example code provides examples of the county based and bounding box based API calls. Some [additional information on the Air Quality System can be found in the EPA FAQ](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata) on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Via this code, developed by David McDonald and modified by Aditi Shrivastava, we obtain estimates of the Air Quality Index from 1985 to 2023 in the city of Rapid City, South Dakota. With this, we hope to compare the AQI stats with our own generated wildfire smoke estimates within the city-- these results can be found in ```code/smoke_estimate_model.ipnyb``` and ```code/data_visualization.ipynb```. Read [here](https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf) for more insight on how the AQI is calculated."
